      "\n",
      "1. Personalized Message: Start by writing a personalized message that expresses your feelings towards Andrew. You could say something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy birthday to my amazing friend Andrew! 🎉 I'm so grateful for our friendship and all the adventures we've shared together. Here's to another year of making memories and creating new ones! 🥳\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Funny Quote: If you want to add a bit of humor to your card, you could use a funny quote that relates to Andrew's personality or interests. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy birthday to my favorite person to hang out with! 😜 I'm so glad we're friends because you make every day brighter and more entertaining. Here's to another year of good times and great memories! 🎉\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Heartfelt Message: If you want to write a more heartfelt message, you could express your appreciation for Andrew's friendship and the impact he's had on your life. Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear Andrew, happy birthday to an incredible friend! 💕 I'm so grateful for the day we met and for the adventures we've shared together. You bring so much joy and love into my life, and I'm so lucky to have you by my side. Here's to another year of love, laughter, and making memories together! 🥳\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Inside Joke: If you and Andrew share an inside joke or a funny story, you could include it in the card for an extra touch of personalization. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy birthday to my favorite person to share a slice of pizza with! 🍕 I'm so glad we're friends because you always make me laugh and you're the best partner in crime. Here's to another year of sneaking into the office kitchen and eating all the snacks! 😜\"\n",
      "\n",

      "2. Meditation and mindfulness: Mindfulness practices, such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga, can help reduce stress and anxiety, improve sleep quality, and boost mood. Aim to set aside 10-15 minutes each day for mindfulness practice.\n",
      "3. Connect with nature: Spending time in nature can have a calming effect and improve mood. Try to spend at least 30 minutes outdoors each day, whether it's walking in a park, gardening, or simply sitting in a sunny spot.\n",
      "4. Socialize: Social connections are important for overall health and well-being. Make an effort to connect with friends and family, or join a social group or club to meet new people.\n",
      "5. Get enough sleep: Aim to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night to help regulate mood, improve cognitive function, and boost immune function.\n",
      "6. Eat a healthy diet: A balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein can help support overall health and well-being.\n",

    "An increasing variety of large language models (LLMs) are open source, or close to it. The proliferation of models with relatively permissive licenses gives developers more options for building applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some different ways to build applications based on LLMs, in increasing order of cost/complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompting. Giving a pretrained LLM instructions lets you build a prototype in minutes or hours without a training set. Earlier this year, I saw a lot of people start experimenting with prompting, and that momentum continues unabated. Several of our short courses teach best practices for this approach.\n",
    "One-shot or few-shot prompting. In addition to a prompt, giving the LLM a handful of examples of how to carry out a task — the input and the desired output — sometimes yields better results.\n",
    "Fine-tuning. An LLM that has been pretrained on a lot of text can be fine-tuned to your task by training it further on a small dataset of your own. The tools for fine-tuning are maturing, making it accessible to more developers.\n",
    "Pretraining. Pretraining your own LLM from scratch takes a lot of resources, so very few teams do it. In addition to general-purpose models pretrained on diverse topics, this approach has led to specialized models like BloombergGPT, which knows about finance, and Med-PaLM 2, which is focused on medicine.\n",
    "For most teams, I recommend starting with prompting, since that allows you to get an application working quickly. If you’re unsatisfied with the quality of the output, ease into the more complex techniques gradually. Start one-shot or few-shot prompting with a handful of examples. If that doesn’t work well enough, perhaps use RAG (retrieval augmented generation) to further improve prompts with key information the LLM needs to generate high-quality outputs. If that still doesn’t deliver the performance you want, then try fine-tuning — but this represents a significantly greater level of complexity and may require hundreds or thousands more examples. To gain an in-depth understanding of these options, I highly recommend the course Generative AI with Large Language Models, created by AWS and DeepLearning.AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Fun fact: A member of the DeepLearning.AI team has been trying to fine-tune Llama-2-7B to sound like me. I wonder if my job is at risk? 😜)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional complexity arises if you want to move to fine-tuning after prompting a proprietary model, such as GPT-4, that’s not available for fine-tuning. Is fine-tuning a much smaller model likely to yield superior results than prompting a larger, more capable model? The answer often depends on your application. If your goal is to change the style of an LLM’s output, then fine-tuning a smaller model can work well. However, if your application has been prompting GPT-4 to perform complex reasoning — in which GPT-4 surpasses current open models — it can be difficult to fine-tune a smaller model to deliver superior results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond choosing a development approach, it’s also necessary to choose a specific model. Smaller models require less processing power and work well for many applications, but larger models tend to have more knowledge about the world and better reasoning ability. I’ll talk about how to make this choice in a future letter.\n",

    "The 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup (Māori: Ipu Wahine o te Ao FIFA i 2023)[1] was the ninth edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup, the quadrennial international women's football championship contested by women's national teams and organised by FIFA. The tournament, which took place from 20 July to 20 August 2023, was jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand.[2][3][4] It was the first FIFA Women's World Cup with more than one host nation, as well as the first World Cup to be held across multiple confederations, as Australia is in the Asian confederation, while New Zealand is in the Oceanian confederation. It was also the first Women's World Cup to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.[5]\n",
    "This tournament was the first to feature an expanded format of 32 teams from the previous 24, replicating the format used for the men's World Cup from 1998 to 2022.[2] The opening match was won by co-host New Zealand, beating Norway at Eden Park in Auckland on 20 July 2023 and achieving their first Women's World Cup victory.[6]\n",
    "Spain were crowned champions after defeating reigning European champions England 1–0 in the final. It was the first time a European nation had won the Women's World Cup since 2007 and Spain's first title, although their victory was marred by the Rubiales affair.[7][8][9] Spain became the second nation to win both the women's and men's World Cup since Germany in the 2003 edition.[10] In addition, they became the first nation to concurrently hold the FIFA women's U-17, U-20, and senior World Cups.[11] Sweden would claim their fourth bronze medal at the Women's World Cup while co-host Australia achieved their best placing yet, finishing fourth.[12] Japanese player Hinata Miyazawa won the Golden Boot scoring five goals throughout the tournament. Spanish player Aitana Bonmatí was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball, whilst Bonmatí's teammate Salma Paralluelo was awarded the Young Player Award. England goalkeeper Mary Earps won the Golden Glove, awarded to the best-performing goalkeeper of the tournament.\n",
    "Of the eight teams making their first appearance, Morocco were the only one to advance to the round of 16 (where they lost to France; coincidentally, the result of this fixture was similar to the men's World Cup in Qatar, where France defeated Morocco in the semi-final). The United States were the two-time defending champions,[13] but were eliminated in the round of 16 by Sweden, the first time the team had not made the semi-finals at the tournament, and the first time the defending champions failed to progress to the quarter-finals.[14]\n",
    "Australia's team, nicknamed the Matildas, performed better than expected, and the event saw many Australians unite to support them.[15][16][17] The Matildas, who beat France to make the semi-finals for the first time, saw record numbers of fans watching their games, their 3–1 loss to England becoming the most watched television broadcast in Australian history, with an average viewership of 7.13 million and a peak viewership of 11.15 million viewers.[18]\n",
